# TODO list for extending RDBMS cover

Remember to update version in POM

1 - Add support for postgres
2 - Install postgres and mysql on laptop and test both RDBMS
3 - Look into dfault values for table PKs e.g. Integer - String mismatch
4 - Move existing unit tests back into project and extend them to cover all RDBMS
    Add option to detect if RDBMS is installed before running tests
5 - Add support for optional dropping of existing database on init
